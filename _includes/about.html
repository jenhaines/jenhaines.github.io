                    <p>I am a skilled IT professional with 15 years experience developing applications for small to large sized businesses. I am seeking a fun and rewarding opportunity in the world of web development, specializing in Ruby on Rails, and Javascript platforms such as Node.js, Jquery, and Angular. Iâ€™ve recently completed a Full Stack apprenticeship at Bloc and am currently enrolled in a Front End development apprenticeship.</p>

                    <p>Working with technology for over 20 years has given me a unique perspective on "how things work" from the inside out. From my time in the Army where I learned how to fix complex communication systems, to providing "round the clock" support at CES responding to a rapidly changing environment, I have consistently achieved my goals through a strong work ethic.</p>
