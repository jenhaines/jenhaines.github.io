![Good Bad Ugly](/img/good-bad-ugly.jpg)

Being from the "show-me" state, I learn best by doing, failing, researching, redoing, and eventually succeeding. Online tutorials have been an essential part my introduction into coding. However with each of these tutorials comes many hours of trying to figure out why things aren't working as described.

I thought as my first post on my blog I would go over *"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"* of online tutorials.

**Good:**

+ Some very generous people have donated their time and effort to give us access to all these great resources for FREE

**Bad:**

+ Unbeknownst to some, many of these tutorials were done years ago. Things change, versions are updated and often the code does not translate to current versions.
+ Some are better than others on proper coding techniques, while others might teach methods that are not really proper or supported.
