As a newbie to the Rails world I used the default database Sqlite for all my applications. Though this works great for learning rails and testing to deploy a real application you need a more robust real database. 

There are many articles on this subject but my goal with this blog is to document my experiences for my won reference and anybody else who may stumble upon this site.

The two most common are PostgreSQL and MySQL. Here I'm going to show you how to switch to PostgreSQL if you have an app already running Sqlite.

Although your Mac may already have PostgreSQL, I prefer to install it to make sure I have the latest version. There are two methods you can use, brew, or install the app. In the past I have had some issues with the homebrew method so I find it easier to just install the app. It can be found [here](http://postgresapp.com/). You can set the app to launch everytime you start your Mac or at your choice(just don't forget to start it before you fire up your Rails app)
